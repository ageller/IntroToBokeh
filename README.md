# Creating Interactive Figures with Bokeh+Python 

Interactive figures allow you and others to dive in and explore your data in real time.  In this workshop you will learn how to use Pythonâ€™s Bokeh visualization library to construct 2D interactive figures.  The majority of this workshop will be hands-on, working through example python notebooks and with time for each of you to construct a beginning interactive figure of your own with my help.  Some prior python knowledge is required.  If possible, please bring your own multi-dimensional data set to explore.

If you don't have Python or Bokeh installed on your computer, but want to run the notebook, you can use the [version on Google colab linked here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yDwkCwtw8f9PVFBGNopUroONr89C6ZjM/view?usp=sharing)
