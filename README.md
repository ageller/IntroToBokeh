# Creating Interactive Figures with Bokeh+Python 

Interactive figures allow you and others to dive in and explore your data in real time.  In this workshop you will learn how to use Pythonâ€™s Bokeh visualization library to construct 2D interactive figures.  The majority of this workshop will be hands-on, working through example python notebooks and with time for each of you to construct a beginning interactive figure of your own with my help.  Some prior python knowledge is required.  Prior to the workshop, please ensure that you have both the `pandas` and `bokeh` python libraries installed on your computer.  If possible, please bring your own multi-dimensional data set to explore.

I encourage you to run the BokehDemos.ipynb notebook from this repo on your computer (instead of in Google Colab).  To do wo, please be sure to install the `pandas` and `bokeh` libraries.  I recommend using conda and creating your own environment for this:
```
conda create -n bokeh-env python=3.10 jupyter pandas bokeh
conda activate bokeh-env
```

If you cannot run this on your computer, you can use the [version on Google colab linked here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ByHW4y21BJui69NcnRDXaz0UDzq-hdTD?usp=sharing)  Please note that some of the procedures differ between the Colab and local versions (particularly, Google Colab cannot handle Python callbacks).
